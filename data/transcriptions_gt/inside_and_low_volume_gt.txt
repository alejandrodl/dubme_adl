 Hi everybody, I'm Abott the audiologist and in this clip I show how I perform a speech hearing test. I want you to imagine you're at a party, this woman is speaking to you. What I'd like you to do is to repeat what you think she says. Take shelter in this tent, but keep still. Take shelter in this tent but keep still. The little tales they tell are false. The little tales they tell are false. Oh, I can hear. Cheap clothes are flashy but don't last. Cheap clothes are flashy but don't... I'm going to leave the rest. This noise is getting louder. Thank you for watching this video. Leave a comment. Let me know what you think. I'm trying to help more people be aware about their hearing health. It's so important that we don't neglect our ears.
