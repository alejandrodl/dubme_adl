 Hi, happy to be with you for another nature walk talk. Well as you can hear the birds are chirping and the children are having a great time on the beach and it's a windy and chilly day and just so glad to be with you for this nature walk talk because once again a day that may not look as inviting as one thing turns out to be filled just filled with the beautiful sounds of nature. Having said that perhaps I should stop talking and we can just listen to nature. I think I'll do that. Thanks for joining me for another nature walk talk.
