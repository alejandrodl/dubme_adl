 Hi. Happy to be with you for another nature walk talk. Well, as you can hear, the birds are chirping and the children are having a great time on the beach and it's a windy and chilly day. And just so glad to be with you for this nature walk talk because once again, a day that may not look as inviting as we're faced filled, just filled. It was a beautiful sounds of nature. Having said that, perhaps I should stop talking and just listen to nature. I think all of that. Thanks for joining me. I think we'll talk to you.
