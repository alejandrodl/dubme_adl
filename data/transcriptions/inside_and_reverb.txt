 This is how it sounds with the feature turned off. And this is how it sounds with the incredible feature turned on. Even though I have a fan running so close to the microphone and a hammer banging my head. With just one click this AI powered feature makes it all go away and you can use it too. Just search for NVIDIA Broadcast and download it. After you install it in the microphone settings, select your input and turn on Noise Removal. And then in your streaming or recording application, make sure your audio input is set to NVIDIA Broadcast. Now besides the Noise Removal, which works like a charm, there's a lot of echo in this room and the room echo removal works beautifully as well. As you can tell, the echo is gone. All of this insane processing real time is possible with NVIDIA Studio and state of the art, NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs, which is required to run NVIDIA Broadcast. However, if you're using GTX graphics cards, you can still run NVIDIA RTX voice for Noise Removal.
