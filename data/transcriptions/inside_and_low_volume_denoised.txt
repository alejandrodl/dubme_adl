 Hi everybody, I'm Abbot the audiologist and in this clip I show how I perform a speech hearing test. Wait can I imagine your abs are falling asleep, this woman is sweet. But that has to repeat what you think she's saying. Oh, the chat was turned back to the staff. Make sure you're doing this time but keep some. Take out the count of the false. This is the day that she's. Oh, I think we're going to be. She loves it. She loves it. I think we're going to be doing it. She's in so much. It's just like, it's really going to go on. Thank you for watching this video. Leave a comment and let me know what you think. I'm trying to help more people be aware about their hearing health. It's so important that we don't neglect how it is.
