 Hi everybody, I'm Abid the audiologist and in this clip I show how I perform a speech hearing test. Wait, can I imagine your anthropology, this woman is speaking to you. I'd like you to do a repeat what you think she says. Take shelter in this tent, but keep still. Take shelter in this tent but keep still. The little parents they tell are false. There's a tent there, tell them false. Oh, I can hear that. Keep going with the classroom. We're doing a session with you. We're doing a session with you. Keep going. Keep going with the classroom. I could do a message. Let's be like this. I don't know. Thank you for watching this video. Leave a comment. Let me know what you think. I'm trying to help more people be aware about their hearing health. It's so important that we don't neglect how it is.
