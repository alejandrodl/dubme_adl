 Art isn't about technique. It's not about how good you are at rendering. It's about storytelling. So many young artists will look at my sketchbook and say, I could never do that. But here's the thing, you totally can. You're looking at the colors and the inks and the years and years of practice, but that's not what makes my art art. It's how I tell a story and telling a story is something everyone can do. To illustrate, I'm going to recreate some of my travel journal pages left handed. God help me. Okay, let's try this page from my trip to Venice. There's a church here with some water. This is so tough. A statue of a lady of some kind with some scales and a pizzeria sign. Okay, that wasn't a bad swirl. Oh, my writing is so awful and done. And how about the zoo? I got to meet Felix, the Sumatran tiger and this is so bad. I mean, you can kind of tell it to tiger and that's my point. You don't need to be an accomplished artist to make art. Stick figures will do technique, color, line weight, composition, rendering. That all comes later. Open up a sketchbook and tell a story. Any story. So focus on storytelling for now and everything else. We'll be all right.
